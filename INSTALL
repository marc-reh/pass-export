pass export, a password store extension

Copyright (c) 2018 Marc Rehmsmeier


Install the pass-export bash script and the man page:

make install

See Makefile for installation directories.

To change installation directories, eg. installing to /usr instead of
/usr/local:

make PREFIX=/usr install

You can also copy export.bash to the local extension directory
~/.password_store/.extensions (create that directory first if it does
not exist). See the manual page for pass for further details on
extensions.

To read the man page (after installation):

man pass-export


To uninstall:

make uninstall

or

make PREFIX=/usr uninstall
